# calculate-Stardew-Valley-profits

This file aims to calculate and plot the profit lines of two different products in Stardew Valley in a period: Star Fruit Vin and Beer. You can edit different time period, price (due to different ranking for the vine quality), the number of lands and beer makers, growing time, making time, and prices.

Also, since the harvest times of Beer Flow is unlimited in the game, I set the value of harvest_times = 999. However, you can only harvest once a time for Star Fruit in the game!


If you find any problem, feel FREE to point it out! I am happy to discuss with you!
